# Simple example plugin for Kodi mediacenter

This is a simple yet fully functional example of a video plugin for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) mediacenter.
Please read the comments in the plugin code for more details.
An installable .zip can be downloaded from "[Releases](https://github.com/romanvm/plugin.video.example/releases)" tab.

**Note**: the purpose of this example plugin is to show you how to organize and play your media content in Kodi.
The methods of obtaining such content, for example parsing websites or working with various APIs,
are beyond the scope of this example.

**Note2**: this version of the example plugin is compatible with both Python 2 and 3,
and uses `six` library to wrap version-specific Python features. So it may also
serve as a minimal example of hot to create Kodi plugins compatible with Python 2 and 3.

The plugin uses a pre-defined set of free sample videos from [www.vidsplay.com](http://www.vidsplay.com/).

**Warning**: the "master" branch is only compatible with Kody 16.0 (Jarvis) and above. For older versions see the "legacy" branch.
